# Fetch the computational mesh needed to run the WINDSOR case:
#   - MESH/c1g1.cgns  (~1.2 GB)  ~6.3 M cells
#
# The mesh is hosted outside the git repository because of its size.
# Once downloaded, the case directories are self-contained and can be
# run with the standard `code_saturne run` workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   ./fetch_data.sh
#
# The download base URL is configured via the WINDSOR_DATA_URL
# environment variable, or by editing the DATA_URL value below.
